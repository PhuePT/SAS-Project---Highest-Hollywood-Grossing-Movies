Data Analysis and Visualization using SAS - Hollywood Movie Dataset 

Project Summary
The project aims to analyze the top 1000 highest-grossing Hollywood movies to determine which factors contribute to their success in terms of sales. Using data up to January 10, 2022, the project investigates domestic, international, and world sales to provide insights for movie makers and industry consultants.

Project Goal
Objective: To identify key factors influencing the success of Hollywood movies based on sales data.
Dataset: The dataset includes 1000 highest-grossing Hollywood films with details such as movie title, release year, sales figures, runtime, distributor, genre, and license type.

Step-by-Step Analysis
Data Cleaning:
Split movie title and year.
Remove NA values and parse release dates into separate fields.
Change sales values to US currency format.
Convert movie runtime to total minutes.

Data Visualization:
License Types: Visualized the distribution of movies by license type (PG, PG-13, R, G).
Distributors' Sales Trends: Identified highest-earning distributors and their sales trends.
Profitable Release Months: Analyzed which months yield the highest domestic and international sales.

Statistical Analysis:
Summary Statistics: Calculated mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum sales for each license type.
One-Way Frequencies: Determined the frequency and cumulative percentage of different movie distributors.
Correlation Analysis: Assessed the relationship between movie runtime and sales figures.
Linear Regression: Analyzed the impact of domestic sales on world sales, establishing the significance and variation explained by the model.

Insights
License Types: PG-13 movies constitute the highest percentage (58.5%), followed by R, PG, and G.
Distributors: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures leads in the number of movies and sales, with Twentieth Century Fox's "Avatar" being the highest-grossing movie.
Release Months: January is the most profitable month for movie releases both domestically and internationally.

Sales Trends:
Positive correlation exists between movie runtime and sales, with international sales showing a stronger correlation.

These insights help in understanding the dynamics of high-grossing movies and can guide movie makers in planning and releasing successful films.
